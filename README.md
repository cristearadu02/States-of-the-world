# States-of-the-world
# Countries Information API

This project consists of a API (`api.py`) that provides information about countries, and a client script (`client.py`) to interact with the API. Additionally, there is a web scraping script (`find_countries.py`) to extract country names from Wikipedia and store it in a CSV file.A PostgreSQL database is utilized to store and retrieve country data.

## Files

- **api.py**: Flask API providing endpoints to retrieve information about countries, including population, density, area, GDP, languages, and time zone.
- **client.py**: Client script to interact with the Flask API by making requests to specified endpoints.
- **find_countries.py**: Web scraping script to extract country names from a Wikipedia page and store them in a CSV file.
- **wikipedia_api.py**: Parses the CSV file generated by `find_countries.py` and inserts country data into a PostgreSQL database.
- **countries.csv**: CSV file containing country names.

## Getting Started

1. Install the required packages.
2. Run `find_countries.py` to scrape country names and generate the `countries.csv` file.
3. Run `wikipedia_api.py` to update the PostgreSQL database with country data.
4. Start the Flask API by running `api.py`.
5. Use `client.py` to make requests to the API and retrieve country information.
